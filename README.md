## Getting Started

This Repo is a compilation of MANY sites and organizations that gatters this hosts (ARROUND 30 sites)
also is a campilation of many compilators from here, github.

I used a notepad++ plugin that deletes repetitive lines so this hosts are Unique.

### Need to Know
+ A hosts file is a local file stored on the computer that translates domain names or NetBIOS names into an IP addresses.
When looking up an IP address, the computer will first look at the hosts file to resolve the name. If the name is not in the local hosts file, it will try resolving using a Domain Name Service (DNS), and if also not found the lookup will fail.
T
he hosts file is one of several system facilities that assists in addressing network nodes in a computer network. It is a common part of an operating system's Internet Protocol (IP) implementation, and serves the function of translating human-friendly hostnames into numeric protocol addresses, called IP addresses, that identify and locate a host in an IP network.

In some operating systems, the contents of the hosts file is used preferentially to other name resolution methods, such as the Domain Name System (DNS), but many systems implement name service switches, e.g., nsswitch.conf for Linux and Unix, to provide customization. Unlike remote DNS resolvers, the hosts file is under the direct control of the local computer's administrator.
