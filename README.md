### WHAT. IS. THIS?

A hosts file is a file that translates domain names into an IP addresses.
When looking up an IP address, the computer will **first look at the hosts file** to resolve the name. **If the name is in the local hosts file as not allowed, you cannot access the site..** 

So here is the `Trick`: instead of blocking sites, it only blocks the ADS

**Example** - the following entry `0.0.0.0 ad.doubleclick.net` blocks all files supplied by that [DoubleClick](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubleclick "Wikipedia Definition of Doubleclick") an AD-Server to the web page you are viewing. This also prevents the server from tracking your movements.

This repository is a compilation of several reputable `hosts` files, But more importantly, My Own!
and merges them into a `unified host` file with **duplicates removed**. 
I use a notepad++ plug in that deletes repetitive lines so all of this entries **are unique**.
